@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the EXTI and use
GPIOs to toggle the user LEDs available on the board when
a user button is pressed. It is based on the STM32F4xx LL
API. Peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary services
functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI13) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.

In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - EXTI13 is connected to PC.13 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on EXTI13 by pressing User push-button, LED2 toggles

On NUCLEO-F411RE:
    - EXTI13 is connected to User push-button
