@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the IWDG to ensure period counter update and
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a user button is pressed. Peripheral initialization is 
done using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
LED2 is blinking fast & continuously.

Example Execution:
When User Button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disable and thus, reset will occur. After a reset, when re-entering in the main, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the LED2
will be switch ON.

Waiting a new user button pressed to re-activate the IWDG
