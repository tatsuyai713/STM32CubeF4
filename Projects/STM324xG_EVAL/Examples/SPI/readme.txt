  The STM32CubeF4 firmware package provides a set of examples showing how to use the SPI
  in master/slave communication, based on polling, interrupt and DMA programming models.  
  These examples are provided for Discovery boards, below the examples set for STM32F4-Discovery:
    - /Projects/STM32F4-Discovery/Examples/SPI/SPI_FullDuplex_ComPolling
    - /Projects/STM32F4-Discovery/Examples/SPI/SPI_FullDuplex_ComIT
    - /Projects/STM32F4-Discovery/Examples/SPI/SPI_FullDuplex_ComDMA
